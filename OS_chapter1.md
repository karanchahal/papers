# Operating Systems

Operating systems sit between the hardware and user programs. There are 2 modes:

1. User Mode
2. Kernel Mode

The kernel mode allows for access to IO and performing some control ops. The user mode has a restricted instruction set available to it. Generally the user programs call into the kernel mode through a system call to perform some important operation. 

What an operating system actually does.

1. Provide application programmers a clean set of resources to develop on instead of messy hardware ones.
2. Manage the messy hardware resources.

Operating systems turn ugly hardware and its messy complicated usage patterns into beautiful abstractions that application programmers can use. Operating systems deal a lot with abstractions.
